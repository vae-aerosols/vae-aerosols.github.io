        <br> Our method is the first to classify aerosols with a global warming potential and identify their chemical and physical properties. Utilizing the Single Particle Soot Photometer along with a form of unsupervised machine learning, we can help guide regulatory practices for these aerosols.

            Harnessing aerosols to cool the climate has immense potential to counteract anthropogenic global warming. However, reliably predicting the cooling effect from such techniques is immensely challenging due to poor understanding of the chemical and physical properties of aerosols. To this end, my project focuses on developing a computational platform that takes raw aerosol signals from a specialized instrument used in ground-based and airborne field studies to measure aerosols, and provides an accurate classification of their properties by using a variational autoencoder (VAE). First, I trained the VAE on a large pool of unlabeled aerosol signals, learning patterns between raw signals that make each aerosol unique and clustering similar aerosols together. Next, a new, unseen signal was passed into the trained VAE, which encoded the signal into a latent representation extracting its most relevant features. Finally, this latent representation was compared to the latent representations determined by thousands of previous observations to identify key information about the aerosol’s properties based on aerosols with similar latent representations. This unsupervised machine learning approach reduces reconstruction error loss by ~23.3 compared to past metrics that rely on alternative clustering approaches such as Principal Component Analysis – PCA. The VAE generalizes well to real-time ambient atmospheric aerosols and does not require training datasets from laboratory samples. By uncovering properties like saturation, incandescent intensity, and peak height with high precision, my platform significantly advances interpretation of aerosol observations. This work is significant because it furthers public understanding of the properties of atmospheric aerosols so they can effectively be used in the future to address global warming by cooling the climate.

            3D Representation, Channel 0 (Optical Size Channel): The autoencoder achieves much better separability with higher latent space dimension. Classes such as Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 are easily distinguishable – as is FSglyc and FS. The irregularity of clustering for CFA and VA is due to their unpredictable signal as they travel within the Single Particle Soot Photometer:

            After encoding the SP2 signals into the latent space, the trained decoder can be used to map out the latent space representations in terms of representative channel 0 and channel 1 time series. These latent manifolds illustrate specific physical and chemical properties of the aerosol time series signals such as symmetry, saturation, and incandescent intensity. The saturation of signals in the channel 0 time series shows flatness at the peaks, which is more common for larger particles like Arizona Test Dust, California Fly Ash, and Virginia Ash. The iron oxide aerosols Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 have more common symmetric scattering signals and a greater incandescent intensity. The peak height of the incandescent signal is known to be proportional to the total mass of an aerosol particle.

          Achieving a nuanced understanding of aerosols at a chemio-physical level is essential for the development of accurate climate models and the formulation of effective climate mitigation strategies. Enhanced models, informed by detailed knowledge of aerosol behavior, could inspire innovative climate engineering solutions aimed at artificially increasing the presence of reflective aerosols to counteract global warming.<br><br>

          Our work is the first that doesn’t need tremendously large, painstakingly labeled datasets or delicate instrument calibration to properly understand aerosols and generalize. Instead, we focus on extracting the key features that comprise aerosols, embedded into a manageable latent space, which allows us to classify aerosols much more effectively.<br><br>
          
          The implications of my work extend far beyond more effective aerosol classification. Through clustering of shared features in our latent space, we can classify aerosols in atmospheric conditions that are unseen during training – which is bound to happen given the changes we are seeing manifest in our climate. We can quickly identify atmospheric anomalies, new and harmful aerosols that arise from human activities, and assess their properties to quickly determine diagnoses. We can generate new training samples by using cluster-based label propagation, allowing us to dramatically increase the amount of aerosol data available to use without needing any complex instrumentation to collect it. This approach overcomes the limitations inherent in supervised learning, offering a scalable and efficient pathway to gain critical insights into the atmospheric aerosols that contribute to emissions.<br><br>

          With improved understanding of aerosols, strategies such as Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI), Cloud Albedo Enhancement, and Solar Radiation Management (SRM) could see substantial advancements. Enhanced knowledge about the reflective properties of different aerosols could inform the selection of materials for SRM projects, ensuring they are both effective and minimize unintended consequences. Similarly, Cloud Albedo Enhancement, which involves seeding clouds with particles to increase their reflectivity and thus cool the planet, would benefit from a nuanced understanding of which aerosol types are most efficient at cloud brightening without adversely affecting cloud precipitation patterns. Lastly, SAI can capitalize on the potentially cooling effect of aerosols to counteract the widespread rate of global warming.
